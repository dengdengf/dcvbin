The model provides two optional analysis modes: The standard mode uses the pre-trained DNABERT model to extract sequence features, combined with k-mer frequency and sample-specific coverage features. After feature fusion via variational autoencoders, two-step adaptive clustering is performed to bin the sequences. The enhanced mode adds domain-adaptive pretraining before the standard process, fine-tuning DNABERT on user data to improve feature extraction capabilities for specific microbiomes. Both modes automatically complete the entire pipeline, from raw data to quality assessment, with the enhanced mode incorporating domain adaptation training, which significantly improves new species identification but requires more computational resources. Users can choose the most suitable analysis mode based on specific research goals and available computational resources.
